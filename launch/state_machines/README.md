This folder contains three launch files that are useful when giving demos:
* free_mode.launch: this launches ED with localization in a known environment. Therefore, it entirely depends on the environment in which this is used.
* demo_intern.launch: launches gmapping and ED without localization but with the RoboCup plugin. The furniture objects that are present in the 'robotics_testlabs' environment can be swiped into the world model.
* demo_mode.launch: launches gmapping and ED without localization but with the RoboCup plugin. The furniture objects that are typically taken to external demos can be swiped into the world model.
